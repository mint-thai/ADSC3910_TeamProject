## Values Exercise
Each team member should pick from [this list of common personal values](https://brenebrown.com/resources/dare-to-lead-list-of-values/) their **top 5 personal values** and provide a brief definition or description for each.  
This helps the team understand each member’s priorities and perspectives.

### Example:

**Name:** Mint Thai
| Value | Definition / Example |
|-------|---------------------------------------------|
| Accountability | I value accountability and appreciate when team members take ownership of their responsibilities. To me, this means following through on commitments and ensuring that what you’ve been assigned is delivered as expected. It builds trust and reliability within the team.
| Transparency | I appreciate open communication, especially when things don’t go as planned. For example, if you can’t make a meeting, letting the team know early helps us adjust. Similarly, if your workload becomes overwhelming or if something isn’t clear, being upfront allows us to support each other and find solutions together.
| Thoughtfulness & Teamwork | I value care and thoughtfulness in the work we produce. It’s not about perfection, but about paying attention to detail and putting in the effort to deliver meaningful work. This also means stepping in when something needs to be done, offering help, and contributing to solutions rather than waiting for direction.

**Name:** [Chaitanya Thirampuram]  

| Value | Definition / Example |
|-------|---------------------|
| Responsibility | I consider taking whole charge of the work that's assigned to them as a duty and finishing it in time without being irresponsible as a value that I look forward to in any of them I work with |
| Adaptability | As we know, we all come from different backgrounds. I'm easily adaptable to most things, and I value someone who can easily adapt and work in different environments. |
| Time | As every one knows time is the most valuble thing ever, so if some thing goes bad before some deadline just letting us know upfront so nobody"s time or energy is wasted. |
| Openness | If something is bothering you, instead of being quiet, it's better to let it out, and being open clears most of the problems in the group. |


**Name:** Cynthia Urrutia  

| Value | Definition / Example |
|-------|---------------------|
| Transparency | Being honest with goals and challenges |
| Accountability | Each member should take ownership of any decisions and the results.] |
| Innovation | Encourage creativity and new approaches without fear of judgment |
| Respect | Valuing each team member's perspective and approach |
